I analyzed several hundred employment records for workers at the Trenton and Kinkora factories of the John A. Roebling â€˜s Sons Company between the 1920s to the 1950s. The Roebling factory complex in Trenton was a major employer and the Kinkora plant employed residents from the company town established by the Roebling company.
