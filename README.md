I analyzed several hundred employment records for workers at the Trenton and Kinkora factories of the John A. Roebling â€˜s Sons Company between the 1920s to the 1950s. The Roebling factory complex in Trenton was a major employer and the Kinkora plant employed residents from the company town established by the Roebling company.

## **Data**
The data used for the analysis was from employee cards that contained a ton of information about the person. These employee cards contained an individuals sociodemographic factors, factors related to an individuals family, factors related to an individuals work history, and factors related to their background. The question being asked was if these factors listed on the employee cards can be used to predict job tenure. Each unit of analysis was one employee card and in total there were 606 cards. The type of sampling strategy that was used was convenience sampling. 

I gathered the data by making a prediction about which variables on the employee cards best predicts job tenure. In total, I thought there were 11 variables on the employee cards that best predicts job tenure. Four of the variables used in our analysis were whether or not an individual could read english, whether or not an individual had a previous job at the company, their age, and number of times they were re-employed by the company.

## **Operationalization**
The variable read english measured whether or not an individual could read english. If an individual could read english, we would categorize this with a 1. If an individual couldn't read english, we would categorize this with a 0. Overall, 39% could read english and 61% couldn't read english.

The variable Any Previous Job measures whether or not the individual had a previous job at the company. If an individual had a previous job at the company, we would categorize this with a 1. If an individual didn't have a previous job at the company, we would categorize this with a 0. Overall, 66% had a previous job at the company and 34% didn't have a previous job at the company.

The variable age measures the age of the individual when they started working at the company. The youngest person was 17 when they first started working at the company, the oldest person was 68, and the average was 39 years old.

The variable re-employed measures how many times an individual was re-employed at the company. The minimum number of times someone was re-employed was 0, the maximum was 9, and the average was 1.
